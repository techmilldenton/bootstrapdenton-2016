#Bootstrap Denton 2016
## This is a static site for the annual Bootstrap Denton event running on Jekyll.

### How to set up Jekyll
We're actually using Octopress 3 underneath, but for the most part, it's just Jekyll. You can either install Octopress by running:

```bash
gem install octopress
```

Which will also install Jekyll, or you can just install Jekyll.

```bash
gem install jekyll
```

Once you clone the repo, switch to the *gh-pages* branch, and in your terminal run `jekyll serve` or `jekyll s`.


### How to contribute.
Really, just submit an issue and follow up with a pull request if you're able to make the fix yourself!
